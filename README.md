# 🚀 JavaScript Internship Repository

This repository contains my daily tasks, coding challenges, and projects completed during my JavaScript internship program. It covers a wide range of JavaScript topics — from fundamentals to advanced concepts — along with several real-world projects.

---

## 📂 Topics Covered
- ✅ JavaScript Fundamentals (variables, operators, loops, functions)
- ✅ Arrays & Objects (methods, destructuring, spread/rest operators)
- ✅ ES6+ Features (arrow functions, optional chaining, sets, maps, classes)
- ✅ DOM Manipulation (events, smooth scrolling, sticky navigation, intersection observer)
- ✅ OOP in JavaScript (prototypes, classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
- ✅ Asynchronous JavaScript (timers, promises, async/await, API calls)
- ✅ Advanced DOM Projects (sliders, modal windows, tab components)
- ✅ Real-world JavaScript applications (Bankist App, Mapty, Forkify)
